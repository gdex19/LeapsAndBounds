# LeapsAndBounds

This is my game for leaps and bounds. It is an infinite
running game with two characters, Jack and Jill. Jack jumps higher
and Jill runs faster. During gameplay, fish and diamonds give you
points. Meteors and rockets will take away both lives and points. 
Also, collecting 20 fish will give you one extra life. 
Rocks kill you instantly. As the game continues, it speeds up, making
it more challenging.

Have Fun and Good Luck!
