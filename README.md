# Leaps and Bounds: The Marathon
Leaps and Bounds: The Marathon is an infinite running game 
in which the player jumps and dodges obstacles, collecting
points along the way.

### About
Choose Jack or Jill, then shrink, jump, and run around until
you lose all your lives or hit a rock. Jack jumps higher,
and Jill runs faster. Watch out for rockets and 
meteors, and collect those fish and diamonds! Also, if you
eat enough fish (20), it might be good for your health. If
you're lucky, you might find an extra life later in the game!

To create this game, I used a lot of examples from the python
arcade library, http://arcade.academy. I also used a solution
I found on stack overflow for the scrolling grass:

Have Fun and Good Luck!
